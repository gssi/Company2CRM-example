# Company2CRM-example
This repository contains an ATL Project called Company2CRM,  transforming models which conform to the Company metamodel into models which conform to the CRM metamodel by means of the [Company2CRM.atl](https://github.com/gssi/Company2CRM-example/blob/master/Company2CRM.atl) transformation. 
## This reposity is composed as follows:
- The *Company2CRM* transformation
- A folder *metamodels* containing the Company (left) and CRM (right) metamodels

- Each folder also includes an <i>evo</i> folder: this folder contains the evolved version of the artifacts.
   
- For example the evo in the root of the repo contains the evolved transformation, 
- The evo in the metamodel folder contains the evolved company metamodel (left), 
- and the evo in the models folder contains the evolved Company model (right) with a relative diagrammatic representation <i>evoCompanyModel.png</i> to inspect the evolved model without installing the complete bundle.
